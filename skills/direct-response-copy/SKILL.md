# Direct Response Copy

Write copy that sounds like a smart friend explaining something while quietly deploying every persuasion principle in the book.

## The Core Principle

Write like you're explaining to a smart friend who's skeptical but curious. Back up every claim with specifics. Make the transformation viscerally clear.

## Headlines

The headline does 80% of the work. One headline can outpull another by 19.5x.

### The Master Formula

> **[Action verb] + [specific outcome] + [timeframe or contrast]**

- "Ship your startup in days, not weeks"
- "Save 4 hours per person every single week"
- "Build a $10K/month business in 90 days"

### Headline Patterns

**Story Headline** (Caples):
> "They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano... But When I Started to Play!"

**Specificity Headline** (Ogilvy):
> "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."

**Question Headline**:
> "Do You Make These Mistakes in English?"

**Transformation Headline**:
> "From Broke Musician to $100K/Year Music Teacher"

### What Makes Headlines Fail

- Trying to be clever instead of clear
- Forgetting self-interest (what's in it for them?)
- Vague claims instead of specific benefits
- No curiosity gap

## Opening Lines

The first sentence has one job: get them to read the second sentence.

**Direct Challenge**: "You've been using Claude wrong."

**Story Opening**: "Last Tuesday, I opened my laptop and saw a number I couldn't believe."

**Confession**: "I'll be honest with you. I almost gave up on this business three times."

## Body Copy Rules

### Show, Don't Tell

```
WRONG: "Our software is very fast"
RIGHT: "Processes 10,000 records in 0.3 seconds"
```

### Specificity Beats Vagueness

```
WRONG: "Saves you time"
RIGHT: "Cuts your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 12 minutes"
```

### Benefits Over Features

```
FEATURE: "256-bit encryption"
BENEFIT: "Your data is safer than a Swiss bank vault"
```

### Social Proof Patterns

- Numbers: "Join 47,382 developers"
- Authority: "Used by teams at Google, Stripe, and Shopify"
- Testimonials: Specific results, real names, real photos

## CTAs That Convert

### The Formula

> **[Action verb] + [Specific outcome] + [Time/Ease qualifier]**

- "Start building in 60 seconds"
- "Get your free report now"
- "Join 10,000+ developers today"

### CTA Don'ts

- "Submit" (sounds like homework)
- "Click here" (vague)
- "Learn more" (weak desire)

## The AIDA Framework

1. **Attention**: Hook with headline/opening
2. **Interest**: Build curiosity with specifics
3. **Desire**: Paint the transformation
4. **Action**: Clear, urgent CTA

## The PAS Framework

1. **Problem**: Agitate the pain they feel
2. **Agitate**: Make it worse, show consequences
3. **Solution**: Present your answer

## Voice Guidelines

### Do
- Use contractions (you're, it's, don't)
- Write short sentences
- Use "you" more than "we"
- Be specific, never vague
- Sound like a person, not a company

### Don't
- Use jargon without explanation
- Write long paragraphs
- Use passive voice
- Make claims without proof
- Sound corporate or stiff

## Quick Reference

| Element | Good | Bad |

| Headline | "Save 4 hours every week" | "Increase productivity" |
