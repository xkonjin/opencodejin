# Railway CLI Command Guidelines

## Commands That Timeout (AVOID)

These commands often hang or timeout in Cursor terminals:

```bash
railway logs --service <name>
railway logs --service <name> | tail -50
railway logs --service <name> 2>&1 | head -30
```

## Safe Alternatives

### Check Deployment Status (Fast)
```bash
railway service status --service <service-name> 2>&1
```

### Check Environment Variables
```bash
railway variables --service <service-name> --kv 2>&1 | grep <VAR_NAME>
```

### Set Environment Variables (triggers redeploy)
```bash
railway variables --service <service-name> --set "VAR_NAME=value" 2>&1
```

### Check Health via HTTP (with timeout)
```bash
curl -s --max-time 5 https://<domain>/health 2>&1
```

### View Recent Logs via Railway Dashboard
Instead of CLI logs, direct user to: https://railway.app/project/<project-id>

## Deployment Wait Pattern

Don't use `sleep` loops. Instead:
1. Trigger deployment (e.g., set a variable)
2. Check status once immediately
3. Tell user to check Railway dashboard or run status command manually in ~2 minutes
